Episode 10
- We will be using Stripe
    -We will be using Stripe as our payment provider. We will not be using Cashier, or any payment library other than Stripe SDK.
     To create a payment for an order, the front end/mobile app/interface whatever will talk to the API, will talk to stripe, create a payment intent - and then this will be used to track payments going forward.
     This payment intent will need to be stored on the server side - so that we can track progress.
       Order:
         attributes:
           id: int
           ...
           intent: string

           Payment:
             attributes:
               id: int
               ...
               intent: string
