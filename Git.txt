02:12 | Git vs Github
    Git
      Is a version control software
      Is used as a command line tool and ran locally
      Tracks code and version history
      Allows you to work on different versions/branches of a code base
      Helps to synchronise different versions of the same code base
         (Local code base , remote code base etc)

    Github (UI)
      Is a web application that hosts remote git repositories
      Owned by Microsoft
      Is deeply integrate with git
      Provides extra functionality on top of git
      Mainly used by teams of 2 more people

03:53 | Installing Git
       https://git-scm.com/downloads
04:14 | Init Local Repository
   REMOTE REPOSITORY
   Are hosted on server that is accessible for all team members
   developers will see the code
   developer will push the code to the remote

   LOCAL REPOSITORY
   Reside on te computer of a team member
   Other developers won't see the code in local
   -Code will look different from other
   -git init
   -cd "DCD"
07:26 | Staging Area & Git Tracking
    git status
    local area
    staging area
      git add .
      git status
      git rm --cached test.php
    commit area
     git commit -m "..........."
     -checking point
     -add manually and you can come back
     -Store many information
     -Commit locally in you machine
     -Take those commit to remote
     -Pull all commit into local  repository

08:23 | Git Status
       git status
10:35 | Add and Remove From Staging Area
       git add .
       git rm --cached test.php
11:41 | Commits
      git commit -m  "first commit"
      git status

15:00 | Branches
     A branch represents an independent line of development,
     the git branch command lets you
     create ,
     list,
     rename
     and delete branches
     MASTER BRANCH
       -Production code where its lives after tested and approved by sn/manager
       -Don't modified to master

     DEVELOP BRANCH
       -Is the copy of master branch has different features
       git checkout -b develop
       git status
       git add .
       git commit -m "commit to develop"
       This commit I changed to the developer branch doesn't affect the master branch
       All the change made in the develop branch lives in develop branch and doesn't reflect to the master
                git checkout master
                git checkout develop
                    one commit ahead of master branch
                git branch
                    View all branches

20:48 | Merging Branches
       We create a develop branch and tested the code ,
       Code  has been approved /reviewed by manager
       Time to put into master
       WE CALL Merge
         *extend branch
         master  branch
         develop branch
         git checkout master
         git merge extended

         NB: If the changes has happened to master and bring back to develop branch
         git merge master
         git checkout master


22:09 | Merge Conflicts
      Example: Readme.md in local - changed
      Example: Readme.md in remote - changed
      The error will shown on code .u need to delete manually top look as u want
     This happened to file conflicts together during changes
      git commit -am "cccccc"
      git checkout develop
      git commit -am "modified"
      git checkout master
      git merge develop
         Auto-merging test.py
         CONFLICT : merge conflict in test.py
         Automatic merge failed;fix conflicts and then commit the result
         git commit -am "merge extended"
         git push

25:17 | Remote Repositories
       -create new repository
       -Rename the branch to main
       git checkout master
       git branch -M main
       git branch
       git remote add origin https://............
       git remote
       git push -u origin main

       NB OTHER NEW BRANCH
     You can push other branches to origin
       git checkout develop
       git push origin develop

       NB:Go to github ,you will see the message
            Compare & Pull request Button
              You can make Draft Pull Request

     You change something in remote repository
     The main branch in local repo will be behind one_step
     git checkout main
     git pull origin master- will pull all the changes from remote rep to local repo
              -It update local branch  from repos if there changes

31:00 | Git Clone
   copy the code to ur machine
   git clone url
Local Repositories
Track and Untracked Files
