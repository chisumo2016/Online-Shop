==> Upgrading mariadb
  10.4.13 -> 10.6.4

Error: Cannot install mariadb because conflicting formulae are installed.
  mysql: because mariadb, mysql, and percona install the same binaries

Please `brew unlink mysql` before continuing.

Unlinking removes a formula's symlinks from /usr/local. You can
link the formula again after the install finishes. You can --force this
install, but the build may fail or cause obscure side effects in the
resulting software.
